a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

   Ensure you have the necessary imports at the top of your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:project_setup/project_setup.dart';
   ```

## How to use

To use the Project Setup plugin in your Flutter project, you can add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

- **Dimensions**: It provides a set of extension methods for `num` to easily get the width and height of the screen. 
  To initialize dimensions before running the app, use the following in your `main` method:

  ```dart
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) { 
    AppDimensions.init(context);  
    return MaterialApp();
  }
  ```

  ```dart
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ScreenUtilInit(
      designSize: const Size(360, 690),
      minTextAdapt: true,
      splitScreenMode: true,
      child: MaterialApp.router(
        routerConfig: AppRoutes.router,
        title: 'Flutter Demo',
        debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
        theme: ThemeData(
          colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
          useMaterial3: true,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
  ```
 

## How to use API Calling

```Dart

// How to Initialize Api Repository and pass the API URL and headers as project

Future<void> main() async {
  // âœ… Initialize your plugin API and pass the API URL and headers as project
  await ApiRepository.init(
    apiUrl: "",
    appHeaders: {
      'authorization': "",
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'AppVersion': '1',
      'DeviceTypeId': Platform.isIOS ? '2' : '1',
      'accessToken': "",
      'LanguageCode': 'en',
    },
  );
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

```

## User Api Calling Funtion

```Dart


var body = {
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "Test@123",
  "deviceToken": "",
  "deviceType": Platform.isIOS ? 2 : 1,
  "userType": 1,
};

void callApi() async {
  try {
    final response = await ApiRepository().post(
      endpoint: 'Account/Login',
      body: body,
      fromJson: (data) => data as Map<String, dynamic>,
    );

    if (response.success && response.data != null) {
      CommonUtilMethods.showSnackBar(
        context: context,
        message: response.message ?? "Login successful",
      );
    }
  } catch (e) {
    if (context.mounted) {
      CommonUtilMethods.showSnackBar(
        context: context,
        message: e.toString(),
      );
    }
    PrintLogs.showErrorLogs(e.toString());
  }
}


```
